# @todo #54:30min. Positive infinity and negative infinity tests are needed.
#  They were missed for some reason but to aviod potential bugs these objects
#  has to be tested. Also needs to remove nop object from series test where
#  series works with infinities (when object try is able to work with
#  infinities)
